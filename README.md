# Daily-Planner

The Daily Planner has a standard 9 to 5 work day set up with the current date displayed on the top. Depending on the time of the day, your schedule is broken up in the 3 categories: past, present, or future and color-coded accordingly. The informtaion entered into the schedule can be saved into local storage for future use, or removed by deleting the information and saving the emptied area.
